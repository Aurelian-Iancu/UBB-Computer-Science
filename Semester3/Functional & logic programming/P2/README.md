# P2

* Heterogeneous lists in Prolog.
    * Write a predicate to determine the sum of two numbers written in list representation.
    * For a heterogeneous list, formed from integer numbers and list of digits, write a predicate to compute the sum of all numbers represented as sublists.
    * Extra during laboratory: create a list with the non-list elements.
