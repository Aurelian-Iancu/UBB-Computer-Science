# R1
# Problem 5.
* Write a recursive program (Python or C++ programming language) for the followingrequirements.You can use and extend for implementation the C++/Python model available in /Lab/R1, this model already containing recursive implementations for creating, printing and destroying of a List.It is mandatory to work with a structure/class List.For a Listwill be used a linked representation. Do not use containers from STL or predefined operations on lists in Python (append, len, slicing, etc.).
    * Determine the greatest common divisors of elements from a list.
