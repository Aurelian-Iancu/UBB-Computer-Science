# Data structures and algorithms

* Requirements
    * Design and implement an abstract data type directed graph with many functionalities. You ll see them.
    * Write a program that finds the connected components of an undirected graph using a breadth-first traversal of the graph.
    * Write a program that, given a graph with costs and two vertices, finds a lowest cost walk between the given vertices, or prints a message if there are negative cost cycles in the graph. The program shall use the matrix multiplication algorithm.
    *  Write a program that, given a list of activities with duration and list of prerequisites for each activity, does the following:
		1.verify if the corresponding graph is a DAG and performs a topological sorting of the activities using the algorithm based on depth-first traversal (Tarjan's algorithm);
		2.prints the earliest and the latest starting time for each activity and the total time of the project.
		3.prints the critical activities.
    * Given an undirected graph with costs, find a Hamiltonian cycle of low cost (approximate TSP) by using the heuristic of sorting the edges in increasing order of their costs and, for each edge, choose it if and only if it does not close a cycle of length lower than n.
