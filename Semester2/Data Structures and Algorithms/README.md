# Data structures and algorithms

* Requirements
    * Bag - represented using a  dynamic  array  of<element,  frequency>  pairs  (or  two dynamic arrays).
    * Sorted Indexed List - using a  DLL  where elements are ordered based on a relation.
    * Sorted Iterated List - using  a  DLLAwhere elements are ordered based on a relation.
    * Sorted Bag - using  a  hashtable  with  open  addressing (double  hashing) in  which  the elements are stored. If an element appears multiple times, it will be stored multiple times in the  hashtable.In  the  constructor of  the  iterator  create  a  sorted  array  of  the  elements  and use that array for iterating.
    * Sorted Multimap - using  a BST with linked  representation  on  an  array.In  the  BST uniquekeys are stored with a dynamic array of the associated values.
