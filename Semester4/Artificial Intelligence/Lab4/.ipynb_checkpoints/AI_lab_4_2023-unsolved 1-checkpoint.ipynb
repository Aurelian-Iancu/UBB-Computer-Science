    "## Common activation functions for ANN:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sigmoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid function is a popular choice for activation functions in neural networks. It has an $S-shaped$ curve:\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a number of appealing qualities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Nonlinearity*: Because the sigmoid function is nonlinear, it enables the neural network to simulate nonlinear interactions between inputs and outputs. A neural network would simply be a linear model without a nonlinear activation function like sigmoid, which would significantly restrict its capacity to describe complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Smoothness*: As the sigmoid function is differentiable and smooth, its derivative exist at every point. This is significant because it makes it possible for neural network training techniques based on gradients (such as backpropagation) to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Boundedness*: The sigmoid function is bounded between 0 and 1, it means  its outputs can be interpreted as probabilities.  It is most useful in applications like binary classification, where the goal is to predict whether an input belongs to one of two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Monotonicity*: The sigmoid function is monotonic, which means that its outputs are always increasing or always decreasing with respect to its inputs. This makes it easy to interpret the effect of changes in input variables on the output of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReLU function is defined as $$f(x) = max(0, x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a widely used activation function in deep learning due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\tanh$ function is similar to the sigmoid function but produces outputs in the interval $[-1, 1]$:  \n",
    "$$f(x) = \\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{e^{x}+e^{-x}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Softmax:\n",
    "\n",
    "The softmax function is commonly used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems. It normalizes the output into a probability distribution over the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a vector $\\vec{z}$ of $n$ real numbers, the softmax function calculates a vector $\\vec{s}$ of $n$ real numbers with the components:\n",
    "$$s_j = \\frac{e^{z_j}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} {e^{z_k}}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Leaky ReLU:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Leaky ReLU is a variation of the ReLU function that introduces a small non-zero gradient for negative inputs. It is defined as \n",
    "$$f(x) = max(0.01 \\cdot x, x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ELU (Exponential Linear Unit):\n",
    "\n",
    "The ELU function is another variation of the ReLU function that introduces a small negative saturation value for negative inputs. It is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\biggl\\{ \\begin{matrix} x, & for & x > 0 \\\\\n",
    "                      \\alpha \\cdot (e^{x} - 1), & for & x \\leq 0 \\end{matrix}$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Swish:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Swish function is a recent activation function that is a smooth approximation of the ReLU function. It is defined as f(x) = x * sigmoid(x)."
