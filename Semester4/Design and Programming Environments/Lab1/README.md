# Lab 1 assignment

**Points**: 1

**Deadline**: Week 2

**Last chance deadline and penalties**: Week 4, -0.3 points / week delayed

----

Choose any programming language and a **backend** framework and setup a development environment in it. Create an application with CRUD functionalities for a single entity of your choice. The entity should have at least 5 attributes, not counting the ID. You do not need any validations.

Remarks:
- Your application should either expose a REST API (like Django REST Framework, Flask) or a webpage that can be accessed in the browser (like Django)
- Console apps are **not** allowed
- Frontend frameworks / libraries (React, Angular) are **not** allowed
- You should be able to explain basic things about your framework of choice (where routes are defined, how the models are handled etc.) 
- You will also be marked on good coding practices and design principles, as they have been taught in Fundamentals of Programming and Object Oriented Programming and as they apply to your choice of framework

Suggestions:
- You can probably find libraries in your favorite language that help you build Web applications and REST APIs
- I suggest you make a REST API, as that will become mandatory later on anyway
- Java has Spring, Python has Django, C# has WebApi etc. The keywords to search for are your language + rest api
- Make sure you get comfortable with reading your choice's documentation and that you pick something with an active community, as you will be spending a lot of time studying stuff on your own
